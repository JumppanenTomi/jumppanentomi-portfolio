# Personal Portfolio Website
## About Me
Welcome to my personal website, crafted to showcase my projects and potentially evolve into a platform for sharing insights through a blog. Feel free to draw inspiration from here for your own portfolio, but please refrain from duplicating the entire page or its elements to maintain the uniqueness of my portfolio.

## Technology Stack
- Developed using React
- Powered by Vite
- Deployed on Vercel
- Utilizes i18next for localization
- Integrates Font Awesome for icons
- Leverages React Bootstrap for fundamental layout components
- Implements React Router for seamless navigation, incorporating URL parameters for dynamic content. In the future, I may do transition from a single landing page to a multi-page structure.
